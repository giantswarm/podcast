[Web Scraping in 2024: Protect Ya Neck](https://x.com/tunahorse21/status/1844589100608668035?s=61)). The two main keys of web scraping in 2024 are infrastructure & tactics.

[The CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) has voted to accept Flatcar as a CNCF incubating project](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/10/29/flatcar-brings-container-linux-to-the-cncf-incubator/) "A secure community-owned cloud native operating system was one of the missing layers of the CNCF technology stack,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of CNCF. Flatcar has hit several milestones in the last several months, which have contributed to the project’s move to the incubator:
**- System Extensions.** Leveraging the capabilities introduced in recent systemd releases, Flatcar has adopted system extensions (sysexts) as the strategic path forward for customizing and enhancing the base operating system. 
**- Run in more places.** Flatcar supports more operating environments than ever, including ARM64-based servers, with Azure Cobalt being a recent addition; out of the box support for Nvidia Tesla GPUs for AI workloads; and many public clouds.
**- Cluster API.** The upstream Cluster API project now supports Ignition-based distros including Flatcar, and there are Cluster API integrations for Flatcar with a variety of platforms including Azure, AWS, and VMware.

This is the story of how (not) to build development environments in the cloud.

[Building an Application-Specific Container Image Builder| James Laverack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAgxyyL-7LI)) Lightning talk about going to far to solve a problem. In his self-proclaimed talk about "perhaps the most boring title I could write". His goal was to put a modified version of Minecraft into his Kubernetes Cluster at home and ran into all kinds of issues. He opened up with how he actually got it done: _Multthreaded Rust programs building handcrafted artisinal multi-architecture container images by rewriting tarballs in flight during download._ (7 minute lightning talk)
