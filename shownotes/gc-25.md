[Web Scraping in 2024: Protect Ya Neck](https://x.com/tunahorse21/status/1844589100608668035?s=61)). The two main keys of web scraping in 2024 are infrastructure & tactics. With affordable & easily accessible defenses like Cloudflare, even small apps can protect themselves in a way that can stop most scrapers. But if you want to scrape at scale for fun or profit the process is outlined step-by-step.

[The CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) has voted to accept Flatcar as a CNCF incubating project](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2024/10/29/flatcar-brings-container-linux-to-the-cncf-incubator/) "A secure community-owned cloud native operating system was one of the missing layers of the CNCF technology stack,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of CNCF. Flatcar has hit several milestones in the last several months, which have contributed to the project’s move to the incubator:
**- System Extensions.** Leveraging the capabilities introduced in recent systemd releases, Flatcar has adopted system extensions (sysexts) as the strategic path forward for customizing and enhancing the base operating system. 
**- Run in more places.** Flatcar supports more operating environments than ever, including ARM64-based servers, with Azure Cobalt being a recent addition; out of the box support for Nvidia Tesla GPUs for AI workloads; and many public clouds.
**- Cluster API.** The upstream Cluster API project now supports Ignition-based distros including Flatcar, and there are Cluster API integrations for Flatcar with a variety of platforms including Azure, AWS, and VMware. 

[GitPod is leaving Kubernetes](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/we-are-leaving-kubernetes). This is not a story of whether or not to use Kubernetes for production workloads. It's also not the process of how to build a comprehensive soup-to-nuts developer experience for shipping applications on Kubernetes. This is the story of how (not) to build development environments in the cloud.

[Building an Application-Specific Container Image Builder| James Laverack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAgxyyL-7LI)) Lightning talk about going to far to solve a problem. In his self-proclaimed talk about "perhaps the most boring title I could write". His goal was to put a modified version of Minecraft into his Kubernetes Cluster at home and ran into all kinds of issues. He opened up with how he actually got it done: _Multthreaded Rust programs building handcrafted artisinal multi-architecture container images by rewriting tarballs in flight during download._ (7 minute lightning talk)

[What makes a {dev} platform?](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-T9xopIN-SCzQPQPCCMQi3gLecWJolDVewYQAEQSR4g/edit?tab=t.0) Joe Beda recently gave a talk and drafted a comprehensive document about what makes a Dev. platform. Our colleague Łukasz Piątkowski said that this excerrpt really stood out to him: "It is obvious to many, but I want to stress that an API is critical to any platform. The API is the purest expression of your object model. While you can imagine a platform that is completely UI based and focused on non or casual developers, an API is almost always a must.  Platforms are built to be built upon.  Assuming you will always be at the “top of the stack” will limit your reach."
