### Ingress NGINX - or: A day in the life of a maintainer.

> "Wait, you're doing what? Coding? In your free time? For free? Nobody is paying you?"

In this episode of Giant Conversations we would like to dive into the world of Open Source, find out how you can contribute to it, which challenges you might face, which lessons you can learn, and how you can become a reviewer or a maintainer of a project.

We therefore invited James Strong, Isovalent at Cisco, and Marco Ebert, Giant Swarm, both maintainers of the Kubernetes Ingress NGINX project, to have a chat about their past, present and future experiences and challenges.
