### Main topic: Interviewing Liz Rice

**Questions:**

1. 100's of people lined up at KubeCon. Invited to all the events. Asked to speak on webinars, at meetups, at conferences... How does it feel being a cloud native celebrity? 
2. How did you end up in the Kubernetes space? There is the saying: we stumbled upon our greatest successes, but you only stumble if you are walking? Did you just walk where you liked it or did you target something?
3. If you had to put your day in percentages, what amount goes where? Obviously everything Isovalent connected but how much internal, wider community, book writing, speeches, podcasts :) ?
4. In a rapidly evolving cloud native landscape, staying up-to-date can be a challenge. How do you approach staying informed?
5. You are a diverse character? Which 3 Books would you recommend for somebody in IT? How to manage developers? Write Product Specs? Invest your Time? ...
6. What did the Kubernetes Community Fuck up in the Last Few Years and Approved upon? What is our biggest risk?
7. What are the most important things to focus on when using Kubernetes, ignoring all the buzz word bingo? Does that change over time or are there things set in stone you need to never lose sight of?
9. You're known for your ability to explain complex technical concepts in a clear and engaging way. What's your secret sauce for making topics accessible and entertaining for a wide audience?
10. If you could create a new CNCF project to solve any problem in the cloud native space, what would it be and why?
11. If you could take over kubernetes.io for a day. Clean slate, one page, to everyone in our ecosystem and add your your idea or message. AND everyone has to do "it" â€” what would be your message and why?
