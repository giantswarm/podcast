### Manufacturing IIoT - Why is IIoT Important?

Introduction to Manuel Gawert

Q: Why should a traditional manufacturer care about adopting IIoT now?

Q: Can you give a real-world example /use case of how our IIoT platform helps improve factory operations?

### Manufacturing IIoT - Delving In

Q: What's the "high-level" approach to scaling IIoT infrastructure across multiple facilities or geographic locations?

Q: How do Kubernetes-native architecture benefit industrial customers compared to legacy systems?

Q: How is IIoT important to digital transformation trends like AI, cloud adoption, or supply chain automation?

**Manufacturing IIoT at Giant Swarm**

Q: Do these platforms (our platform) help reduce costs? I'm sure they do, but how?

Q: _Just gonna read this one - no idea to what I'm even saying here GO:_ How do we handle interoperability with existing factory systems like SCADA, PLCs, and MES platforms?

Q: Where do you see the future of manufacturing heading with platforms like ours?

**Evolving the Industrial IoT playbook**
As manufacturing technology continues advancing, we’re developing new perspectives on what drives successful digital transformation:

- Standardize the foundation, not the ceiling — The most innovative manufacturers create consistent technological foundations while encouraging creative applications that address unique operational needs.

- End-to-end visibility transforms decision-making — When data flows seamlessly from production through supply chain, quality, and customer feedback, manufacturers gain unprecedented ability to optimize across traditional boundaries.

- The compound interest of digital transformation — While direct efficiency gains matter, the compounding effects of better decision-making, faster problem-solving, and increased organizational agility deliver the most significant long-term returns.
