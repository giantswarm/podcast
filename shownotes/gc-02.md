### Main topic

* KubeCon
  
  * Kubecon — taking place between March 19th and March 22nd, in Paris
  * 21 Swarmies attending the conference
  * We’ll be at Booth K11 — the easier way to find us is to simply look for the booth with the cool, colorful graphics saying “Smarter Platform Engineering — creating environments for growth”
  * Swag at the booth? We’ll have cool t-shirts in different colors; cool stickers and raffle prizes that Tommy can talk about
  * How are our colleagues getting there? About half of the people are travelling by plane, another half travelling by train; Timo is coming by car
  * Accommodation: most of the Swarmies are staying in a hotel close to the venue; the Swarmies attending Cloud Native Rejekts prior to KubeCon, are staying in an AirBnB
