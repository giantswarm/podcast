### News from #swarmalicious

- [Broadcom/VMware: If this isn't a case of pricing a customer out then I don't know what is](https://twitter.com/cioontherun/status/1760770717040115988)
 a current Broadcom VMware customer went from an $8M renewal to $100M. The employee reviews on Glassdoor say it all. “CEO admits he has no hobbies outside of work. Stock price only thing that matters.” 
- [Octopus Deploy acquires Codefresh to unite industry-leading Continuous Delivery, CI, and GitOps capabilities into a single, trusted enterprise platform](https://octopus.com/news/octopus-acquires-codefresh) The press release mentions that Octopus Deploy is now one of the largest privately held companies in the DevOps ecosystem, with impressive customer and revenue numbers. How do you think this acquisition positions them against other players in the CI/CD market?
- [New CNCF contribution view (seems to only count code contributions and is limited to Kubernetes project)](https://contribcard.clotributor.dev/) Marcus is in the lead at Giant Swarm (with over 121 contributions to 12 repositories) and with Jose behind him with 102 contributions to 11 repositories. 
- [Cloudflare open sources Pingora, its Rust-based HTTP proxy framework, to advance adoption of memory-safe infrastructure for a more secure Internet](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pingora-open-source) Pingora, the proxy that connects Cloudflare to the Internet, and serves more than 40 million Internet requests per second! So, I heard Cloudflare just open sourced something called Pingora. It sounds like a new type of pasta, but apparently it's actually a big deal in the tech world! Can you break it down for me?
- [Alex Richardson update on Weaveworks and Flux](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richardsonalexis_hi-everyone-i-am-very-sad-to-announce-activity-7171213301555666945-16RJ/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android) As discussed last week, Weaveworks hit bad times, but the good news is that most of their team has already found new jobs, which is a testament to how talented they are. Now, Alexis is talking about transitioning Weaveworks from a company to more of a community focused around their open source projects, especially Flux. 
- [The continued support of FluxCD at GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/03/05/the-continued-support-of-fluxcd-at-gitlab/) What does this tell us about the role of commercial companies in supporting open source projects in the cloud native space?
- [Akin to SBOM, Trivy Adds KBOM Vulnerability Scanning to K8s](https://thenewstack.io/akin-to-sbom-trivy-adds-kbom-vulnerability-scanning-to-k8s/) KBOM stands for Kubernetes Bill of Materials, which I initially thought was a receipt for all the coffee and energy drinks needed to keep a tech team running. But no, it's actually more like a master list of all the components that make up a Kubernetes system.

### Bug of Week (from our Retrospectives)

Another recent one was with a customer that got a new management cluster because they needed it fully private from the public one before. We migrated the Workload Clusters with clusterctl, an upstream projects, a CLI to start clusters through CAPI but you can also move clusters. It worked well. But days later, when a new node joined the workload cluster, the encryption key (that K8s uses to encrypt secrets) that it used to get to (old) secrets didn't work. The reason is that clusterctl expect you to move the old encryption key to the new management cluster so that when the new workload cluster starts, the master gets that key and can still distribute further to new nodes but all the encryption aligns. As we did not move the encryption key to the management cluster, all old nodes were fine as they could get to  the secrets that are still in etcd (encrypted with the old one) but the new node got a totally diferent secret information.
