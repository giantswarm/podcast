### News from #swarmalicious

- VMWare is still a talking point with posts on [license increase from $8 to $100m](https://twitter.com/cioontherun/status/1760770717040115988) and Glassdoor reviews stating: “CEO admits he has no hobbies outside of work. Stock price only thing that matters.” But there are also [more balanced views](https://moorinsightsstrategy.com/research-notes/cutting-through-the-vmware-noise/)
- [New CNCF contribution view (seems to only count code contributions and is limited to Kubernetes project)](https://contribcard.clotributor.dev/) Marcus is in the lead at Giant Swarm (with over 121 contributions to 12 repositories) and with Jose behind him with 102 contributions to 11 repositories. 
- [Cloudflare open sources Pingora](https://blog.cloudflare.com/pingora-open-source) which is written in Rust, fully async and multithreaded, and their framework for building HTTP proxy services. Lots of info for the tech minded through the link, but the framework includes client and server, and lots of utility library and they area actively working with the Internet Security Research Group Project [Prossimo](https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/introducing-river) to make the most critical infrastructure secure. 
- [Alex Richardson update on Weaveworks and Flux](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richardsonalexis_hi-everyone-i-am-very-sad-to-announce-activity-7171213301555666945-16RJ/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android) As discussed last week, Weaveworks hit bad times, but the good news is that most of their team has already found new jobs, which is a testament to how talented they are. Now, Alexis is talking about transitioning Weaveworks from a company to more of a community focused around their open source projects, especially Flux. 
and Gitlab has emphasized their [continued support of FluxCD](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2024/03/05/the-continued-support-of-fluxcd-at-gitlab/). These tools just need to get into the hands of big companies that can use it to make money in another way.
- [Akin to SBOM, Trivy Adds KBOM Vulnerability Scanning to K8s](https://thenewstack.io/akin-to-sbom-trivy-adds-kbom-vulnerability-scanning-to-k8s/) KBOM stands for Kubernetes Bill of Materials, so a Software Bill of Materials, just specifically for Kubernetes. I'll talk about it next week with Zach.

### Bug of Week (from our Retrospectives)

Another recent one was with a customer that got a new management cluster because they needed it fully private from the public one before. We migrated the Workload Clusters with clusterctl, an upstream projects, a CLI to start clusters through CAPI but you can also move clusters. It worked well. But days later, when a new node joined the workload cluster, the encryption key (that K8s uses to encrypt secrets) that it used to get to (old) secrets didn't work. The reason is that clusterctl expect you to move the old encryption key to the new management cluster so that when the new workload cluster starts, the master gets that key and can still distribute further to new nodes but all the encryption aligns. As we did not move the encryption key to the management cluster, all old nodes were fine as they could get to  the secrets that are still in etcd (encrypted with the old one) but the new node got a totally diferent secret information.
