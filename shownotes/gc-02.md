### Bug of Week (from our Retrospectives)

Another recent one was with a customer that got a new management cluster because they needed it fully private from the public one before. We migrated the Workload Clusters with clusterctl, an upstream projects, a CLI to start clusters through CAPI but you can also move clusters. It worked well. But days later, when a new node joined the workload cluster, the encryption key (that K8s uses to encrypt secrets) that it used to get to (old) secrets didn't work. The reason is that clusterctl expect you to move the old encryption key to the new management cluster so that when the new workload cluster starts, the master gets that key and can still distribute further to new nodes but all the encryption aligns. As we did not move the encryption key to the management cluster, all old nodes were fine as they could get to  the secrets that are still in etcd (encrypted with the old one) but the new node got a totally diferent secret information.
