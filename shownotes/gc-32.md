### This years Team Onsites

**Location:** Mallorca - near Santanyi

**Sessions:**

Team Atlas and Cabbage: _Release Requirements Session_
- Release-as-a-Service
- Consistency across clusters (less exceptions)
- Testing as integral part of releases
- Be on a cluster fast (like weekly at least)
- Transparency for customers in a structured way

Planeteers: (OLI FILLS IN)

TeamUp: 
- Improving feedback sessions
- Modular marketing services
- How we analyse conversion data
- Brainstorming using new methods: _Rapid Ideation with AI Assistance_
- Gifts and company SWAG (we are relaunching the Shop)

Shield:

- Adopting Kubescape as our platform "core" (from Trivy)
- Kubescape would enable some features we don't currently have, but it is either missing or duplicating some we do have

_Example:_ 
- Anomaly detection. Falco is also CNCF and has lots of users, so it's not clear whether we'd ditch it for Kubescape's agent.

Are there things that even the expensive commercial tools don't do that we can do for customers?

_Examples:_
- L1 security oncall - we take the pager for certain types of security issues and are the first entrypoint / triage for them
- Active remediation of findings - the scanner says "this is bad" and we make it good by actually working on customer applications

**Any fun stories?**

TeamUp got to run into 3 other teams while there - Teams Cabbage, Atlas, and Shield

Jonas swam around 300 Meters to a deserted Island

Jonas also snuck out at night with a night camara and came back with 2 sea cucumbers. He also mentioned that he scared some people

We tested the well in the house - it works.. the water was probably not potable

**Next Onsite?**

Alicante - the whole company

### Swarmalicious AI News

[Mary Meeker's Bond AI Special Report:](https://www.bondcap.com/reports/tai)

340 slides into her new BOND “Trends – Artificial Intelligence” report. If you want to get the most out of it - ask ChatGPT to summarize it for you: 

Easy Takeaway - Adoption
- Facebook 4.5 years to reach 100M users
- ChatGPT 0.2 years

[Old AI News](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/21/chatgpt-new-memory/) - Starting today [April 10th 2025], memory in ChatGPT can now reference all of your past chats to provide more personalized responses, drawing on your preferences and interests to make it even more helpful for writing, getting advice, learning, and beyond.

Reference: Dress this dog in a pelican costume. Sign in the back written _Half Bay Moon_
_The previous memory feature—where the model would sometimes take notes on things I’d told it—still kept me in control. I could browse those notes at any time to see exactly what was being recorded, and delete the ones that weren’t helpful for my ongoing prompts._
