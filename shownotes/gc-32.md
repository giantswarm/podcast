### This years Team Onsites

**Location:** Mallorca - near Santanyi

**Sessions:**

Team Atlas and Cabbage: _Release Requirements Session_
- Release-as-a-Service
- Consistency across clusters (less exceptions)
- Testing as integral part of releases
- Be on a cluster fast (like weekly at least)
- Transparency for customers in a structured way

Planeteers: (OLI FILLS IN)

TeamUp: 
- Improving feedback sessions
- Modular marketing services
- How we analyse conversion data
- Brainstorming using new methods: _Rapid Ideation with AI Assistance_
- Gifts and company SWAG (we are relaunching the Shop)

Shield:

- Adopting Kubescape as our platform "core" (from Trivy)
- Kubescape would enable some features we don't currently have, but it is either missing or duplicating some we do have

_Example:_ 
Anomaly detection. Falco is also CNCF and has lots of users, so it's not clear whether we'd ditch it for Kubescape's agent.

- Are there things that even the expensive commercial tools don't do that we can do for customers?

_Examples:_
- L1 security oncall - we take the pager for certain types of security issues and are the first entrypoint / triage for them
- Active remediation of findings - the scanner says "this is bad" and we make it good by actually working on customer applications

**Any fun stories?**

TeamUp got to run into 3 other teams while there - Teams Cabbage, Atlas, and Shield

Jonas swam around 300 Meters to a deserted Island

Jonas also snuck out at night with a night camara and came back with 2 sea cucumbers. He also mentioned that he scared some people

We tested the well in the house - it works.. the water was probably not potable

**Next Onsite?**

Alicante - the whole company
