### Main topic: Cloud native predictions for 2025

Looking Ahead: 2025's Unfolding Story

### Predictions gathered from Swarmalicious:

**1. Gateway API:**
The release of Gateway API v1.2.0 in November 2024 introduced features such as WebSocket support, timeouts, and retries

The upcoming Gateway API v1.3 is expected to be released around the end of January 2025. It will possibly include:
- Expanded Protocol Support
- Enhanced Configuration Options
- Improved Observability
- Authentication and Security Enhancements
- Better Cross-Cluster and Multi-Tenancy Support
- User experience and usability (UI)

**2. Stronger focus on UI: Flux, Headlamp, Backstage etc.:**

Why Together They Matter and complement each other:
- Flux ensures operational consistency through GitOps.
- Headlamp simplifies operational management for Kubernetes clusters.
- Backstage abstracts Kubernetes details to enhance developer productivity.

This will help solve:
Developer and Operator Alignment: Together, they bridge the gap between infrastructure operators and application developers.
Improved Kubernetes Adoption: By addressing different pain points, these tools lower the barrier for Kubernetes adoption across organizations.

**3. More indie community activity. KCDs and more "grassroots" style events and communities (the CNCF is still very active in these):** 
- DevOpsDays
- KCDs
- CloudNativeDay events
- Industry-Specific Kubernetes Communities
Financial Services: _FinOps Foundation_, _Cloud Native Financial Services Day_ (CNCF)
Healthcare and Life Sciences: _HealthTech User Groups_ (Focus on HIPPA Compliance and Security)
Telecommunications: _Open Networking Foundation_, _Kubernetes in Telco_ (CNCF SIG)
Gaming: _Game Developers Kubernetes Group_, _Open GameStack Initiative_
Manufacturing: _CNCF IoT Edge Working Group,_ _Industry 4.0 Kubernetes Group_
Retail and E-Commerce: _Retail Kubernetes Users Group,_ _CNCF App Delivery SIG_
Automotive: Autoware Foundation, CNCF Edge Computing SIG

**4. Formalisation in the platform space around capabilities and maturity:**

This formalization is driven by the need to manage complexity, foster innovation, and ensure scalable, secure, and reliable platform ecosystems.
- Platform Capability Frameworks
- Maturity Models
- Governance and Compliance
- Metrics for Measuring Maturity
- Collaboration Between Teams
- Adoption of Standards
- Emphasis on Innovation and Adaptability
