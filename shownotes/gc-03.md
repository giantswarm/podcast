### Bug of Week (from our Retrospectives)

With karpenter for cost savings, we are reaching cilium API limits due to lots of pods being evicted and need to raise those limits. Pawel then managed to figure it out. NetworkPolicy Objects with CIRDs are the culprit. Without NetworkPolicy objects everything went fine. When also 500 NetworkPolicy Objects were created each with 10 random CIDRs in them, node_local identities went up to 70k, causing cilium timeouts, causing pods being stuck in ContainerCreating. Especially for single IP networks, cilium creates 31 secondary labels. Packing single IP CIDRS into slightly bigger subnets should help. We have an [upstream issue for it](https://github.com/cilium/cilium/issues/31497).
