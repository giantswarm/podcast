- [More news from Hashicorp](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/opentofuorg_opentofu-project-was-recently-made-aware-activity-7182147077496344576-jsDQ/) It seems that OpenTofu, an open source project, has been accused by HashiCorp's lawyers of violating the terms of the Business Source License (BSL) under which HashiCorp's Terraform codebase is licensed. OpenTofu strongly denies any wrongdoing, suggesting that HashiCorp may be confusing code that was previously open-sourced under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) with more recently developed code released under the BSL. OpenTofu is investigating the matter and plans to provide a detailed written response explaining their position in the coming days.

In the future, these reports will need to be more detailed, and smaller companies will also be required to comply. In Europe, 11,700 of the largest, exchange-listed companies, banks, and insurers will have to report their greenhouse gas emissions for the first time in 2025 under the CSRD. These companies have more than 500 employees each and were previously covered by the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD).

In addition, 83% of companies say their platform engineering team has been crucial to improving regulatory compliance and 43% of organizations have had a platform team for 3-5 years.
