### Main topic

From KubeCon in Paris, we asked our guest this question:
_Can successful open source projects only originate from organizations that donâ€™t prioritize monetizing the project?_

Cortney's answer resonated with us in the era of new Open Source Licensing, and we just had to have her on.

**Theme:** Corporations and Open Source:
- How should corporations approach and engage with open source projects?
- What are the benefits and challenges for corporations when getting involved in open source?

**Theme:** Open Source as a Business Model:
- Can open source be a sustainable business model for companies, especially those founded specifically for an open source project?

**Theme:** Role of Big Tech Companies:
- Do you think big tech companies should be the primary drivers of open source projects?
- How do the contributions and influence of big tech companies shape the open source ecosystem?
- Should we expect open source innovation to primarily come from big tech companies, or is there room for smaller players and community-driven projects?

**Theme:** Balancing Corporate Interests and Open Source Values:
- How can corporations strike a balance between their commercial interests and the values of the open source community?
- What are some best practices for corporations to engage with open source projects in a mutually beneficial way?
- How can corporations foster a culture of open source contribution and collaboration within their organizations?

In the future, these reports will need to be more detailed, and smaller companies will also be required to comply. In Europe, 11,700 of the largest, exchange-listed companies, banks, and insurers will have to report their greenhouse gas emissions for the first time in 2025 under the CSRD. These companies have more than 500 employees each and were previously covered by the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD).
