In the future, these reports will need to be more detailed, and smaller companies will also be required to comply. In Europe, 11,700 of the largest, exchange-listed companies, banks, and insurers will have to report their greenhouse gas emissions for the first time in 2025 under the CSRD. These companies have more than 500 employees each and were previously covered by the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD).
