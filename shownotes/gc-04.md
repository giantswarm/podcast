Intro:
Just got back from KubeCon
12,000 attendees 
Great vibe
Fun parties
Beautiful city

We talked to a handful of people at Kubecon to get their take on a wide range of topics. Some we just grabbed from the crowd (soundbite: 2-3 people introducing themselves), others from our ecosystem (soundbite: 1-2 intros) and even brought in a couple of our lovely colleagues(1-2 intros).

We drafted a bunch of questions and asked them to answer the ones that they felt most comfortable covering. Questions like If KubeCon had a theme song what would it be (soundbite), or Should the cncf be harder on their requirements for graduated projects. And of course (sound bite from Tommy) What's the coolest piece of swag or freebie you've picked up at the conference?. We got a lot of mixed answers except for that last one (soundbite (plushy x3-4 and then Courtney rant on her plushies). That last one was Courtney Nickerson. We'll hear more from her later. Gotta hear her opinion on monetizing open source - but that'll come later.

Naturally, questions about swag are the softer and easier ones, kind of like warm up questions. But the ones that seemed to bring even more passion (than the plushies?), were the questions about the topics discussed at KubeCon... (Which were?)

There were three big ones:
- AI of course - hell, there were even sponsors who couldn't explain what they did. It was just like "we do AI.. do you want a water bottle?"
eBPF
- Sustainability or in this case, the lack thereof
- (And) Web assembly (booo)

So we'll bounce around a little bit on the topics discussed. But some things were continuous. Like AI.. Not everyone was so enthralled with the, "" quote "AI KubeCon" (AI soundbites)

It's happening at every conference I've heard about. It's the new (something poignant). From educational conferences to waste management, and of course tech - but you can't fool this bunch, it was considered the content specifically tailored to our future overlords.. not making this up. 

eBPF was a much loved topic on the other hand. You could see peoples faces literally light up when talking about the newest capabilities. (Soundbites)

Web assembly... (?) can showcase based on time available

Now on the less sexy but more important topic - or surprisingly, lack there of, was the discussion over sustainability. I mean, the Gartner quadrant puts sustainability (NEED A RELEVANT FACT HERE), but of those we talked to said it was rarely mentioned in the talks this year like it had been in the past. For example, here is a specific take on sustainability from Pini Reznik the CEO and Co-Founder of re:cinq. (Soundbite Pini). 

We heard about these topics as the top ones for the vast majority of our peers. But there was one in general that got people red in the face. It's the "elephant in the room" discussion. "Monetizing Open Source". Everyone we asked gave me the cringe look in one way or the other. With companies like Weave works..... (NEED IFO) and others like VMware (NEED INFO) the opinions were all very similar (soundbite from Udo and others). There are companies out there doing something about this. Courtney Nickerson was very excited to put in her 2 cents on this one. You can tell it's from the heart and I think for our listeners, a you're not alone moment (soundbite).

OK, we get it. That last bit is way heavier than favorite swag or poking fun at AI (watch it with talk like that. They'll come and get you). Hey, I'm a share holder, what can they do? Let's finish up strong though, this is a good one. We talked to Frederic Branczyk and he had 2 points to bring up that deviated from the standard questions but was ready to spill. (Soundbite about Chip Size from Frederic).

Fun quote from Frederic or Courtney)
