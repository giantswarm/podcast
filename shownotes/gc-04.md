**Intro:**
Just got back from KubeCon
12,000 attendees 
Great vibe
Fun parties
Beautiful city /French are FAR nicer than the stereotypes 

**KubeCon Discussions:**
We talked to a handful of people at Kubecon to get their take on a wide range of topics. Some we just grabbed from the crowd (soundbite: 2-3 people introducing themselves), others from our ecosystem (soundbite: Intros).

We drafted a bunch of questions and asked them to answer the ones that they felt most comfortable covering. Questions like If KubeCon had a theme song what would it be, or what's the coolest piece of swag or freebie you've picked up at the conference?. We got a lot of mixed answers except for that last one (soundbite (plushy x3-4 and then Courtney rant on her plushies).

Four main topics stood out to our audience:
- AI
- eBPF
- Web Assembly
- Sustainability
- Open Source Monitization
