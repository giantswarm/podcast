The Kubecon one. 

We need three questions to ask people about Kubecon while at Kubecon: 
* What did you see you learned?
* Which booth was the best visit and why?
* What are the best talks?
* What did you like?
* What kind of people are you running in the most?
* Did you submit a topic and did you hold it?
