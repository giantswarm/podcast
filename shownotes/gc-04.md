### News from Swarmalicious

- [Euro-cloud consortium CISPE calls for investigation of Broadcom](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/21/cispe_vmware_broadcom_license_warning/) Lobby group CISPE – a collective representing Cloud Infrastructure Providers in Europe – has called for regulators to investigate VMware by Broadcom’s software licensing arrangements, claiming will bankrupt some of its members and hurt end-users. CISPE secretary general contended that Broadcom “is holding the sector to ransom by leveraging VMware’s dominance of the virtualization sector to enforce unfair license terms”. He called for Broadcom to be designated as a gatekeeper under Europe’s Digital Markets Act.

- [Redis is no longer open source](https://redis.com/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/) All future versions of Redis will be released with source-available licenses. According to this blog post, in practice, nothing changes for the Redis developer community who will continue to have access to permissive licensing under the dual license; Redis will also continue to support its vast partner ecosystem – including managed service providers and system integrators. It really means that you can't provide a managed service or Redis, like cloud providers do, without agreeing to a license.
