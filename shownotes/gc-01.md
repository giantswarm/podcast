### Bug of Week (from our Retrospectives)
tl;dr: We enabled Loki on leopard yesterday. It should send logs to an object store. That object store is internal, but Loki was (mis)configured to use their proxy. Their proxy refuses the connection as it's an internal target it can not resolve. Their proxy logs the access and as Loki retried it a lot, their proxy's log volume filled up to 100% which resulted in their whole proxy service breaking down.

Therefore several other services, including our login to leopard didn't work anymore.
