### Monitoring and Observability for Beginners

Just for Tommy: [Grot Visits Seattle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDuzAFA6uLo) | GrafanaCON 2025 Keynote Opener

Start with the basics: NOT what is Monitoring and Observability -  why is monitoring and observability important for DevOps? What is an example?

### Monitoring and Observability in the News

Observability is evolving: _2025 observability is less about shiny graphs and more about getting answers faster, safely, and at scale._

[Grafana 12 release](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/05/07/grafana-12-release-all-the-new-features/) (May 07 2025): Observability as Code, Grafana Alerting improvements, Grafana Drilldown General Availability, and more

**Key enhancements:**
- Git Sync: experimental support to version-control dashboards and folders via Git from within Grafana, including branch and PR workflows
- CLI tool (grafanactl): manage, pull, push, validate Grafana resources from the command line
- Alerting Improvements: Tool to import Prometheus/Loki alert rules into Grafana-managed alerts, preserving original behavior 
- Grafana Drilldown (Explore Metrics, Logs & Traces) moved to GA

[OpenTelemetry + Grafana Labs roadmap](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/05/20/opentelemetry-with-prometheus-better-integration-through-resource-attribute-promotion/) (May 20 2025)

OpenTelemetry pushed stable, turn-key Spring Boot instrumentation and added resource-aware Prometheus export, so labels like k8s.node.name flow straight into Prom dashboards.

### Monitoring and Observability at Giant Swarm

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Did our first Talk about how we created the Product on "Mastering Observability" Conference!
  - Topic was Observability Platform @ Scale and which challenges we faced when scaling
  - Interesting: Most problems when scaling were organizational instead of technical (observability as a product)
  - ie. one problem: What's actually our product and what's our interface to the customer?
  - ie. second problem: The Vision of the Observability Platform - where do we want to go with it -> Longterm Roadmap
 
- Now working on the roadmap! What progress? 
  - We worked a lot on our Multi-Tenancy concept based on Grafana Organisations that allows us to onboard a customers marketing team into the observability platform!
  - We connect GitOps and ClickOps in Grafana - managing a persisted Grafana with GitOps Resources (Dashboards and Orgs) loaded in, so people can create those resources in the way the like best.
  - Getting AI into the observability platform: directions and reviews!
