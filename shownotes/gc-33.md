### Monitoring and Observability in the News

Observability is evolving: _2025 observability is less about shiny graphs and more about getting answers faster, safely, and at scale._

[Grafana 11.6 release](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/03/26/grafana-11.6-release-all-the-latest-features/) (Mar 26 2025): new data visualization features, LBAC for metrics data sources, alerting updates, and more

**Key enhancements:**
- One-click data links & actions – jump from a metric panel straight to a trace or external runbook.
- Label-based access control (LBAC) for metrics data sources – secure multi-tenant setups without duplicating dashboards.
- Alerting UX polish – live rule previews and quieter default notifications.
- Ideal for Grafana users who self-host and need tighter governance. 

[OpenTelemetry + Grafana Labs roadmap](https://grafana.com/blog/2025/05/20/opentelemetry-with-prometheus-better-integration-through-resource-attribute-promotion/) (May 20 2025)

OpenTelemetry pushed stable, turn-key Spring Boot instrumentation and added resource-aware Prometheus export, so labels like k8s.node.name flow straight into Prom dashboards.


Automatic discovery of apps and services - What it does: [Splunk Observability Cloud](https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-observability-cloud/manage-data/splunk-distribution-of-the-opentelemetry-collector/get-started-with-the-splunk-distribution-of-the-opentelemetry-collector/automatic-discovery-of-apps-and-services) now auto-builds and deploys collectors with a single click, discovers services, and wires dashboards/alerts without YAML.
