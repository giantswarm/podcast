### Swarmalicious News 

[CNCF accepted Flatcar for incubation:](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/991) 
Quote from Thilo Fromm from Microsoft mentioned on Mastadon "After 18 months of work (much more counting preps from before we filed the request." On January 6th Flatcar submitted to be a CNCF project. Was voted in favor at 81% (threshhold needed to be 66% to pass).

[CNCF project, External Secrets - ESO Inc. is launched](https://www.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/1ez2rrt/external_secrets_inc_is_launched_external_secrets/?share_id=8slE7Ejk5guadWO0X7FVw&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&utm_source=share&utm_term=22)
From an advisor of ESO "Let me be super clear on this. Like (u/dshurupov) said, ESO is a CNCF project. It will not change, it will not be hijacted, it will not be closed it will not be taken away from the community. :)"

[Crowdstrike External Technical Root Cause Analysis](https://www.crowdstrike.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Channel-File-291-Incident-Root-Cause-Analysis-08.06.2024.pdf). In a short discussion. Our colleague Joe Salisbury ran the analysis and summed it up for us: "The report on the CrowdStrike Falcon platform incident dated August 6, 2024, details a system crash caused by a mismatch in input parameters for the IPC Template Type in sensor version 7.11. A new Template Type requiring 21 inputs was only provided 20 by the Content Interpreter, leading to an out-of-bounds read and crashes. Mitigations include validating input fields at compile time, adding runtime bounds checks, expanding test coverage, and implementing staged deployments for new Template Instances. The report also outlines ongoing improvements and third-party
reviews to prevent future occurrences."

Improvement of oncall experience, but only supports datadog for now: [Opslane Reducing alert fatigue for on-call engineers](https://github.com/opslane/opslane). Colleagues Theo and Simon had an interesting conversation about Opslane as a tool. Some good insights: The tool offers context and solutions for actionable alerts, supposedly it can grab context from slack or a runbook base. Simoon diagreed mentioning that nothing can beat a well-written Ops-Recipe. 

[Is it time to version Observability? (signs point to "yes")](https://charity.wtf/2024/08/07/is-it-time-to-version-observability-signs-point-to-yes/)
Charity Majors from Honeycomb wrote in a recent blog explaining the differences in what she deems Observability 1.0 in comparison to Observability 2.0. She Breaks down her thoughts about the outdated explanation of the three pillars of observability: metrics, logs and traces. Charity defines and breaks down Observability 2.0 into arbitrarily-wide structured log events and a single source of truth.

[Are Custom Cloud Native Stacks Worth the Tradeoffs?](https://thenewstack.io/are-custom-cloud-native-stacks-worth-the-security-tradeoffs/): I asked Zach why he didn't care for the post. Mainly because it does sum up what we do at Giant Swarm - "Companies shouldn't use lots of CNCF tools, but buy a product that uses those same exact tools." 
**His critiques:**
- "Cloud native security is totally different from traditional enterprise security." Is a common saying, but is deceptive. Security is fundamentally the same, the difference is companies are having to actually practice it now that the ecosystem requires it of them.
- "This isn't meant to be FUD; it's just how it is when you build a custom stack." Except it is FUD, with no actionable takeaway.
- Mentions regulation for SEO without talking about regulation, and overall repeating common phrases without actually giving any guidance.

[A brief history of block storage at AWS](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2024/08/continuous-reinvention-a-brief-history-of-block-storage-at-aws.html): Great article with a lot of interesting data giving you an idea of the scale, like delivering 140 trillion operations across a fleet of SSDs a DAY. Adding Nitro offload cards to speed up networking by not having  the hypervisor dedicate CPU cycles to networking.

### AI News 

- [Google is no longer asking — feed the AI or you’re not in search results](https://pivot-to-ai.com/2024/08/19/google-is-no-longer-asking-feed-the-ai-or-youre-not-in-search-results/). Google has put the hard word on publishers: you can block your stuff from the AI feature — but then you won’t show up in searches.

### News to me

[Invisible laser beam detects what a MacBook user is typing](https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/08/invisible-laser-beam-keystrokes/): The engineer pointed the laser at the back of the computer and was able to decipher the keys typed based on the vibrations of the computer. MacBooks turned out to be the perfect target for the attack, because it works best when you have a very reflective surface to use as the laser target – and the Apple logo on the back of a MacBook screen has an almost mirror-like finish.
