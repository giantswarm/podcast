### News from KubeCon (the behind-the-scenes notes our Swarmies jotted down at the conference)

Customization was a hot topic. First up, we have to mention the kubecolor tool, which adds a splash of color to your kubectl output. It's a small thing, but it makes working with Kubernetes just a little more fun.

In addition, Marian from Giant Swarm highlighted the importance of branded dev portals for enterprises. It's not just about the technology; it's about creating a cohesive experience that aligns with a company's culture.

Moving on to bigger topics, there was a lot of buzz around the kcp project and its potential to simplify multi-cluster deployments. The API export-import capabilities across namespaces could be a game-changer.

We also saw a growing focus on community and contributor engagement, especially around projects like Flux and Backstage. It's great to see an emphasis on maintainer diversity and making it easier for people to get involved.

We also heard about some exciting emerging technologies, like Kratix and its process-oriented approach to platform building, and Keptn, which offers application lifecycle management with promotions, metrics, and traces. Definitely worth keeping an eye on those.

On the security front, there was a growing interest in supply chain security tools and standards.

And of course, sustainability and cost efficiency were major themes, with lots of discussions around cluster autoscaling, vertical pod autoscaling, and the work being done by SIG Sustainability.

### Our KubeCon survey results 

According to our survey, the biggest challenges companies face are hiring the right people, dealing with too many different tools, and lacking time for automation, which leads to operational overload. Interestingly, only 12% of companies couldn't think of any challenges at all.

When it comes to platform teams, every second one named increasing stability and reliability of the platform as their biggest challenge, followed by extending the platform's functionality.

Surprisingly, while we expected platform teams to be understaffed, the majority are actually overstaffed compared to what we consider a good ratio. Yet, there never seem to be enough people to tackle all the topics. This is where Giant Swarm comes in, offering a smarter approach to platform engineering.
