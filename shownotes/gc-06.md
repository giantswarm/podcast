### Main topic

In terms of themes that come up in the news section: 

1. **Open source and cloud native**: Several items focus on open source projects and cloud native technologies, such as the KubeCon talks, Mirantis' focus on open source, and the Cloud Native Night Munich meet-up. 
2. **Licensing changes and their impact**: Both Teleport and Vultr made changes to their licensing or terms of service, which caused some controversy and concern among their users. 
3. **Communication and transparency**: The Vercel and Vultr stories highlight the importance of clear and timely communication from tech companies, particularly when it comes to addressing user concerns or controversies.

### Our KubeCon survey results 

Results of the 412 survey participants (THAT's 3.4% of attendees): [KubeCon Survey](https://giantswarm541978.typeform.com/report/q8pl93tT/MB3shNUtb155zfb7)

The biggest challenges companies face are hiring the right people, dealing with too many different tools, and lacking time for automation, which leads to operational overload. Interestingly, only 12% of companies couldn't think of any challenges at all.

When it comes to platform teams, every second one named increasing stability and reliability of the platform as their biggest challenge, followed by extending the platform's functionality.

Surprisingly, while we expected platform teams to be understaffed, the majority are actually overstaffed compared to what we consider a good ratio. Yet, there never seem to be enough people to tackle all the topics. This is where Giant Swarm comes in, offering a smarter approach to platform engineering.

### News from KubeCon (the behind-the-scenes notes our Swarmies jotted down at the conference)

Customization was a hot topic. First up, we have to mention the [kubecolor tool](https://github.com/kubecolor), which adds a splash of color to your kubectl output. It's a small thing, but it makes working with Kubernetes just a little more fun.

In addition, Marian from Giant Swarm highlighted the importance of branded dev portals for enterprises. It's not just about the technology; it's about creating a cohesive experience that aligns with a company's culture.

There was a lot of buzz around the kcp project and its potential to simplify multi-cluster deployments. The API export-import capabilities across namespaces could be a game-changer.

We also heard about some exciting emerging technologies, like Kratix and its process-oriented approach to platform building, and Keptn, which offers application lifecycle management with promotions, metrics, and traces. Definitely worth keeping an eye on those.

On the security front, there was a growing interest in supply chain security tools and standards.
