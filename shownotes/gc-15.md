## Onsites and Mansions

**Intro to Josh**

**Human Resources / HR Teams Involvement**

- Planning and Logistics 
- Benefits
- Retro's done in the past
- Slide Deck to Teams' mansions
- Has Team-Team noticed any "changes" in the team(s) after an onsite? (negative or positive but looking for positive of course)

**On Location**
- Program / Agenda During onsites
- Activities (Planned vs. spontaneous)
- Locations we've been
- Frequency: (used to do 2 per year)

**Team Mansions vs. Company Onsites**
- History (One Villa in Malloraca)
- Budgets team coordination, why it's important to coordinate Giant Mansions

**Personal - type questions:**
- What makes our onsites different? (cultural question)
- With an unlimited budget, what / where would you go and do?
- QUESTION: Shall we remote feed Oliver into the episode as an "Oli on the beat" where he just fucking shows up while there's lots of jabber and background noise of an actual onsite
