Simon Weald: [Tolerating full cloud outages with Monzo Stand-in](https://monzo.com/blog/tolerating-full-cloud-outages-with-monzo-stand-in)
Monzo introduces "Monzo Stand-in," a backup banking infrastructure hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) designed to maintain essential banking services during outages of their primary platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
**Notes:**
- Independent Operation: Monzo Stand-in runs on GCP, while the primary platform operates on AWS, ensuring that a failure in one doesn't affect the other.
- Essential Services Coverage: During primary platform outages, Stand-in supports vital functions such as card spending, cash withdrawals, bank transfers, balance checks, transaction history, and card freezing/unfreezing.
- Simplified App Interface: When Stand-in is active, the Monzo app automatically transitions to a streamlined user interface, focusing on essential banking features to maintain user accessibility.
- Risk Mitigation Strategy: By developing a separate set of services for Stand-in, Monzo avoids complexities and potential issues related to real-time data replication and consistency between platforms.
