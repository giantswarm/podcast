#### We'll be at KubeCon in London [Drop by booth N450](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/)

Date: 1-4 April 2025 in London

**Giant Swarm Lineup - KubeCon:**
- Marco Ebert: How To Gateway With Ingress - 140 Days InGate

**Giant Swarm Lineup at Rejekts:**
- Marcus Noble: Pod Deep Dive: Everything You Didn't Know You Needed to Know
- Joe Salisbury: The Cluster API Migration Retrospective: Live migrating hundreds of clusters to Cluster API

Oliver's Take: You don't often go to conferences. I've heard there are three kinds of people who go:
1. Heavy learners who can't miss a session, take notes, and bring back boatloads of informatio
2. Those who just kind of hang around and network a bit
3. Those who party till the daytime and go to the conference slightly drunk
4. .... there's proibably a fourth.

#### [The Evolution of IT Operations and Opsgenie](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/evolution-of-it-operations): 
Opsgenie end of support – effective April 5th, 2027: On this date, access to Opsgenie will be shut off, and the product will no longer accessible. Any unmigrated data in Opsgenie will also be deleted at this point.

This a reasonable amount of time to do something about it - right?

#### [Undocumented commands found in Bluetooth chip used by a billion devices](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/undocumented-commands-found-in-bluetooth-chip-used-by-a-billion-devices/)
Researchers have identified undocumented vendor-specific commands in the ESP32 microcontroller, a widely used chip enabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity in over a billion IoT devices as of 2023. 

The security issues include:
- Spoof Trusted Devices: Impersonate legitimate devices to gain unauthorized access.
- Access Data Illegally: Retrieve sensitive information without permission.
- Network Pivoting: Move laterally within a network to compromise additional devices.
- Establish Persistence: Maintain long-term unauthorized access to devices.

#### [On May 5, Microsoft’s Skype will shut down for good](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/on-may-5-microsofts-skype-will-shut-down-for-good/):

Why is Microsoft doing this?
**Integration Challenges:** After acquiring Skype in 2011, Microsoft faced difficulties integrating it into its ecosystem, leading to technical issues and user dissatisfaction. 

**Rise of Competitors:** The emergence of platforms like Zoom and WhatsApp, offering user-friendly interfaces and reliable services, diminished Skype's market share.

**Strategic Shift to Teams:** Microsoft's focus shifted to Teams, a platform that seamlessly integrates with its suite of productivity tools, aligning better with modern communication needs.

Key findings:
- Only 10% of provisioned CPUs are utilized
- Memory utilization averages just 23%
- The gap between provisioned and requested resources is massive— 40% for CPU, 57% for memory

The data for our 106 clusters shows
- CPU Utalization Mean between 9.6% and 13.7%, Max 19.6%
- Memory Utalization Mean between 20.3% and 40.9%, Max 46.7%
