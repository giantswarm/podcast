### Swarmalicious News 

- [Tech titans assemble to decide which jobs AI should cut first](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/04/ai_replacement_jobs/) Tech giants, including IBM, Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Intel, and SAP, have formed a consortium to address the impact of AI on the workforce, focusing on identifying and retraining workers in roles most likely to be automated. The group aims to retrain over 95 million IT workers in the next decade, but concerns remain about the potential for these same companies to use the data to determine which jobs to cut first.
- [More news from Hashicorp](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/opentofuorg_opentofu-project-was-recently-made-aware-activity-7182147077496344576-jsDQ/) It seems that OpenTofu, an open source project, has been accused by HashiCorp's lawyers of violating the terms of the Business Source License (BSL) under which HashiCorp's Terraform codebase is licensed. OpenTofu strongly denies any wrongdoing, suggesting that HashiCorp may be confusing code that was previously open-sourced under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) with more recently developed code released under the BSL. OpenTofu is investigating the matter and plans to provide a detailed written response explaining their position in the coming days.
- [Pini's talk in Cologne at the Sustainable Offsite Meetup with Timo raised some interesting points.](https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2023/aug/carbon-accounting-europe.html) Starting this year, the largest companies in Europe will be required to report their carbon footprint due to the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). In the future, these reports will need to be more detailed, and smaller companies will also be required to comply. In Europe, 11,700 of the largest, exchange-listed companies, banks, and insurers will have to report their greenhouse gas emissions for the first time in 2025 under the CSRD. These companies have more than 500 employees each and were previously covered by the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD).
- [Puppet State of DevOps Report](https://www.puppet.com/blog/state-devops-report-2024) is out.

In addition, 83% of companies say their platform engineering team has been crucial to improving regulatory compliance and 43% of organizations have had a platform team for 3-5 years.
- [A non-technical view on the xz attack from The Economist](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/04/02/a-stealth-attack-came-close-to-compromising-the-worlds-computers) A recent cyber-security scare revealed malicious code inserted into a critical open-source software project by a mysterious contributor, highlighting the vulnerability of the internet's foundations that rely heavily on code maintained by volunteers.
