*Big Ideas. Authentic Perspectives.*

💡 Join the Giant Swarm squad each week as we discuss it all — from leading-edge cloud technologies to people-first philosophies — in our new podcast, Giant Conversations.

## GOALS

* Increase trust and credibility: Show the breadth of our knowledge and topics we have insights into.
* Emphasise that we are an original voice: Celebrate the “Giant Swarm authenticity” (we are different from other vendors or service providers – we have P32, a flat org chart, we don’t have a conventional (siloed) support system with tickets from a queue, etc.

* Establish Giant Swarm as a thought leader: Show a different way of thinking.
